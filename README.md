# Leap Year Algorithm

Write a function that will take any given year and return true it is a leap year or false if it's not.
Remember that a leap year is:

## Rules

- Every year that is evenly divisible by 4
- Except if it is evenly divisible by 100...
- Unless the century is also divisible by 400

Test Data... Make sure it is working!

- 1999 is not a leap year, it should return **false**
- 1992 is a leap year, it should return **true**
- 1900 is not a leap year, it should return **false**
- 2000 is a leap year, it should return **true**
